# Command Central — Copy Draft

## 1. h1 tagline

Your sidebar, sorted by time

## 2. subtitle

What changed today is on top. What changed last week is at the bottom.

## 3. Feature card 1 — Time ordering

**Headline:** Recent changes first

**Description:** Files grouped by when they were modified. Today, yesterday, last week. Not alphabetical. You glance at the sidebar and know what moved.

## 4. Feature card 2 — Staged vs working

**Headline:** Staged and unstaged, split

**Description:** Staged files in one group, working changes in another. You see what's going into the next commit without running git status.

## 5. Feature card 3 — Extension filtering

**Headline:** Filter by extension

**Description:** Show only `.ts`, `.py`, `.css`, whatever. An agent just touched 30 files. Click once, see only the ones you care about.

## 6. Section heading above cards

Three things

## 7. "When it clicks" / "Good for" section

**Heading:** Good for

**Block 1:**
☕ **Picking up where you left off.** Open VS Code in the morning. See what changed overnight without digging through git log.

**Block 2:**
🤖 **Watching agents.** You have three Claude Code instances running. One of them just modified 12 files. You want to know which ones, and when. That's the sidebar now.

**Block 3:**
🧹 **Reviewing your day.** What did you actually touch today? Time groups give you that list. No searching.

## 8. "Plus:" line

Also: multi repo workspaces, configurable time buckets, zero config.

## 9. Install section heading

Install

## 10. Email signup heading + note

**Heading:** Release notes

**Note:** One email per release. Nothing else.
