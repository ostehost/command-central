# Copy Draft v5 — Feature Cards + Plus Line

Rewrites only the three feature card copy blocks and the "Plus:" line.
Everything else (h1, subtitle, layout, install, email, footer) stays as is.

## Card 1 — Text LEFT, hero-v4.svg RIGHT

**h3:** Files fall into Today, Yesterday, Last Week

**p:** Three repos, each with its own section and emoji: 🚀, ⚡, 📦. Inside each, files sorted by modification time. Today on top, last week at the bottom.

**Features narrated:** time sorting (primary), workspace support, emoji icons

## Card 2 — git-status-v8.svg LEFT, Text RIGHT

**h3:** Staged on top, working below

**p:** Two files marked A, ready to commit. Four more in working, marked M and U. Both sections keep their own time groups. One toggle splits them.

**Features narrated:** staged vs. working (primary), time sorting (within sections)

---

## Card 3 — Text LEFT, filter-v5.svg RIGHT

**h3:** Filtered to .ts

**p:** A blue .ts badge in the filter bar. Four of twelve files match. Only those appear. The second workspace is collapsed. Zero matching. ✕ Clear brings everything back.

**Features narrated:** extension filtering (primary), workspace support (cross repo filtering)

---

## Plus line

Plus: Time groups are configurable. Error counts show inline. File type badges label each row. Works in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. Zero config.

---

## Good for section

**Recommendation: keep it.** The three use cases are concrete, specific to the target audience (people working with AI coding agents), and already match the tone. No changes needed.
