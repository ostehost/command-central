# Copy Draft v3

## h1

Code changes, sorted by time

## Subtitle

See what changed, in the order it changed.

## Card 1

**Headline:** Grouped by when they changed

**Description:** Files ordered by modification time. The groups are configurable: minutes, hours, days. Sidebar or bottom panel.

## Card 2

**Headline:** Staged vs. working

**Description:** Separate staged files from working changes. Or don't. One toggle.

## Card 3

**Headline:** Filter by extension

**Description:** Show only .ts. Or .ts and .py. Everything else goes away.

## Plus line

Also: multi repo workspaces, emoji icons per project, zero config. Works in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Good for

An agent just modified files across two repos. You glance at the sidebar. They're listed in the order they were touched.

Morning. You open your editor. Last night's agent run is already grouped by time. No git log.

End of day. What did you actually change? The time groups are that list.
