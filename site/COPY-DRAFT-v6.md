## Hero

**Badge:** Free & open source

**h1:** What just changed?

**Subtitle:** Your agents are writing code. See what they changed, in the order they changed it.

**CTA buttons:** Install for VS Code · GitHub

## Features

**Section heading:** What it does

### Card 1: Time sorting

**Headline:** Sorted by time. Not alphabet.

**Description:** Most recent file on top. Always. Time groups adjust from minutes to hours to days.

### Card 2: Staged vs. working

**Headline:** Staged vs. working

**Description:** One toggle. Staged files separate from working changes. See what's ready to commit at a glance.

### Card 3: Extension filtering

**Headline:** Filter by extension

**Description:** Show only .ts files. Or only .yaml. Stack filters. When an agent touches 40 files, this is how you narrow it down.

### Plus line

Multi repo workspaces · Emoji icons per project · Zero config

## Use cases

**Section heading:** You've been here

### Scenario 1

**Emoji:** 🤖
**Title:** Three agents, one repo
**Description:** Tests, types, and cleanup. All running at once. You glance at the sidebar. Every file, sorted by the minute it changed.

### Scenario 2

**Emoji:** 🔍
**Title:** Agent went wide
**Description:** You asked for a small refactor. It touched 30 files. Filter to .test.ts to check for tests. Filter to .css to see if it changed styling. Seconds, not minutes.

### Scenario 3

**Emoji:** ☕
**Title:** Catching up
**Description:** Agents ran overnight. Open Command Central. Time groups show what changed, hour by hour. That's your morning context.

## Notes for implementation

**On cutting sections:** Every section earns its spot. The use cases aren't generic; they describe the three modes this audience operates in: active steering, investigation, and review. Keep all three.

**On the narrative arc:** The h1 ("What just changed?") is the question every agent user asks ten times a day. The features answer it. The use cases prove it matters. Install is the obvious next step.

**On tone:** This reads like someone who runs this workflow wrote it. No "finally" moments, no "say goodbye to" anything. Just: here's the problem, here's the tool, here's when you'll use it.
